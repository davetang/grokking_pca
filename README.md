# Grokking PCA

Chapter 7 in [Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](https://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/) available under a [CC BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/) license has an excellent section on understanding PCA. I recommend buying a physical copy of the book but it is available for [download](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb/msmb.tar.gz).
